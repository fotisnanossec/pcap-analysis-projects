# Network Traffic Analysis Projects

This repository showcases my projects in network forensics, threat hunting, and security incident analysis using packet capture (PCAP) files. Each project demonstrates my ability to investigate and document network-based security events.

## Skills Demonstrated

* **Network Protocol Analysis:** TCP/IP, DNS, HTTP, TLS
* **Packet Analysis:** Using tools like `tshark` and custom Python scripts for filtering and data extraction
* **Threat Intelligence:** Identifying Indicators of Compromise (IOCs) and cross-referencing them with external sources
* **Incident Reporting:** Compiling technical findings into a clear, structured, and actionable analysis report

## How to Navigate

To view a specific project, click on its folder. Inside each project folder, you will find a dedicated `README.md` with an overview, a `reports/` folder containing the full incident report, and a `data/` folder with the original PCAP file.
